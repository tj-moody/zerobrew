zerobrew improvements todo
==========================

[x] 1. fix ca-certificates "unsupported bottle" error
      - added support for "all" platform bottles (universal packages)
      - test: selects_all_bottle_for_universal_packages

[x] 2. fix python "missing formula" error
      - python doesn't exist, use python@3.13 instead
      - updated benchmark package list with top 100 from Homebrew analytics

[x] 3. make cold installs faster than homebrew
      - parallelized API calls (batch fetching with futures::join_all)
      - parallelized code signing with rayon
      - skip signing already-signed binaries
      - use recursive xattr stripping (single command)
      - only sign executables in bin/, not all Mach-O files
      - test: parallel_api_fetching_with_deep_deps
      - result: 1.3x faster on average, up to 4.4x for some packages
      - warm installs are 17x faster on average

[x] 4. add benchmark suite improvements
      - added --json flag for structured output
      - added --quick flag for abridged package list
      - split POPULAR_PACKAGES and POPULAR_PACKAGES_ABRIDGED
      - created benchmark.yml GitHub Actions workflow with matrix parallelization

[x] 5. write casual README
      - explains design decisions
      - compares to homebrew
      - documents uv inspiration

[x] 6. run benchmark suite
      - tested 20 packages
      - 17 passed, 3 had homebrew link failures (not zerobrew)
      - avg cold speedup: 1.3x
      - avg warm speedup: 17.1x

[x] 7. streaming extraction & connection optimizations
      - streaming extraction: process each package as download completes
      - HTTP/2 connection pooling for API client (pool_max_idle_per_host: 20)
      - HTTP/2 connection pooling for download client (pool_max_idle_per_host: 10)
      - auth token caching with 4-minute TTL (GHCR tokens)
      - test: streaming_extraction_processes_as_downloads_complete

remaining optimization ideas:
- lazy signing (sign on first exec, not install)
- prefetch dependency metadata during downloads
- alternative bottle sources / CDN mirrors
